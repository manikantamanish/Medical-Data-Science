Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

 In this project, our task was to classify tumors into malignant or benign
tumors using features from several cell images.

 We simply extracted some of the cells out of the tumor and imaged them. At
this stage, we don’t know if this cell is malignant or benign. When we say
benign, that means the tumor is not spreading across the body of the patient
and if it’s malignant, that means it’s cancerous or the tumor spreading across
the body of the patient.

 We wanted to specify if the cancer in these images is malignant or benign.The
idea is to teach the machine how to classify images or classify data.

 We extracted some features that mean some characteristics out of the image
such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and so on. And then we
induced all these features into our machine learning model.

 Once the model is trained, we can use it in practice to classify new images.
Hence in this way, we diagnosed cancer.
